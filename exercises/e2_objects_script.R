#Exercise #2: objects

# 1) create an object that includes both numbers and character string



# 2) create a vector object with 15 values. What happens when you set the length to 20?



#3) create an object that includes a list and set recursive to 'TRUE'.

## 3a) What is the difference if you set recursive to 'FALSE'?



#4) create a matrix object that has 3 columns and 5 rows. Name the rows and columns.

##4a) Extract the value in the 2nd row and 1st column.



#5) create an array object that has 3 levels. Each level should have 6 rows and 4 columns. Name the rows and columns.

##5a) Extract the value in the 3rd level, 4th row, and 2nd column.

##5b) If you wanted to extract all the values in the 1st level and 2nd column, what command would you use?


#6) What are the differences between a matrix and an array?


#7) run the following object and show me the code to what type and class of object it is.

m <- matrix(data=1:15, nrow = 5, ncol = 3,
            dimnames = list(c("r1","r2","r3","r4","r5"),
                            c("c1","c2","c3")))

#8) What symbols are you not allowed to use in object names? Why not?


#9) create a data frame object with 4 rows and 4 columns. Give the columns the names of your four favorite cartoon charatcters.

##9a) Assign the data in the data frame's third column to a new object.

##9b) Assign the data in the data frames second row to a new object.
