#Exercise 1: syntax and notation

#1) create 3 objects and assign values to them


#2) what operators are you not allowed to use in object names?


#3) create a vector object with 10 numbers assigned to it


#4) what function would you use to find the number of values assigned to a vector object


#5) is 'R' case-sensitive language? Y/N?


#6) if you type in a command and 'R' returns a '+' sign, then what does that error mean?


#7) demonstrate the two ways you can assign a sequence of numbers to a vector object


#8) please provide the commands that will show the data type of the following objects:

  a <- 5
  
  b <- 7L
  
  c <- "giraffe"
  
  d <- c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)
  
#9) create 2 objects and assign each 5 values

  # using these two objects:
  
  #9a) perform addition. How does 'R' match up the values between the two vectors?
  
  #9b) perform inner and outer multiplication
  
  
#10) create 2 objects, assign one with 4 values and the other with 3 values
  
  # using these two objects:
  
  #10a) perform addition. How does 'R' match up the values between the two vectors?
  
  #10b) 'R' will generate a warning message when you perform this operation. Why is that?
  
#11) peform outer multiplication on 2 objects that have equal lenghths (i.e., the same numbe of values assigned to them)
  
  #11a) assign the output to a new object
  
  #11b) extract the value in the third row and second column
  
  
#12) round the following vector to the nearest 0.1 decimal place
  
  lemon <- pi
  
#13) find the mean of the following numbers: 0.5, 1.618, 4 (hint: you will need to assign to a vector object first)
  
  
#14) create a die with six sides and sample it with and without replacement. what is the difference between the two methods?
  
  
#15) what is one way you can ask for help with a function within 'R Studio'?
